\f0\fs24 \cf0 None of the files in this folder are used by MOFSimplify. They were used by one of the developers (Gianmarco) in getting latent space neighbor functionality up and running on the website (debugging, planning, etc). Some of the code in this folder is effectively used by MOFSimplify in that it is copy and pasted into the solvent removal stability and thermal stability code.}
